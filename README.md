title: R package to estimate biological age training parameters using the Klemera-Doubal algorithm.
---

# Introduction

## Overview

**What does it do?** Estimate "biological age" from a range of biomarkers using the Klemera Doubal algorithm (2006).

**Why?** Estimating biological age gives better leverage on aging, senescence, and disease process than chronological age alone.

## Installation

This package is still in development, but you can install and use it from github using the R library devtools. Here is the code-block:

```
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('bjb40/bioage')
```


## Example



```
#forthcoming

```
